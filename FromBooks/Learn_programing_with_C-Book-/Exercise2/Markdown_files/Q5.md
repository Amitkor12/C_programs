## Give the rules for making up an identifier.
* The C programmer needs to make up names for things such as variables, function names and symbolic constants.
* A name that he makes up is called a user identifier.
* There are a few simple rules to follow in naming an identifier:
    * It must start with a letter or underscore.
    *  If other characters are required, they can be any combination of letters,digits, or underscore.
    * The length of an identifier cannot exceed 63 characters.
    * Spaces are not allowed in an identifier.
    * You cannot use a C reserved word as one of your identifiers.
