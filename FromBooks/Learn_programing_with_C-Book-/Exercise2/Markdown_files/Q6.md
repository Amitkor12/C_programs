## What is a symbolic constant and why is it useful?

A symbolic constant is an identifier that can be used in place of a constant such as 100.
Suppose 100 represents the maximum number of items we wish to process in some program.
We would probably need to use the number 100 in various places in the program.
But suppose we change our mind and want to cater for 500 items.
We would have to change all occurrences of 100 to 500.
However, we would have to make sure that we do not change an occurrence of 100 used for some purpose other than the maximum number of items (in a calculation like principal*rate/100).
