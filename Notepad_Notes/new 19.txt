To convert the given C++ code into C code, you will need to make several modifications. C does not support templates or some of the C++ features used in the code, such as operator overloading. Here's the modified code in C:

```c
typedef double T;

typedef struct {
    T rem;
    T img;
} car;

void car_init(car *obj, const T r, const T i) {
    obj->rem = r;
    obj->img = i;
}

void car_copy(car *dest, const car *src) {
    dest->rem = src->rem;
    dest->img = src->img;
}

void car_assign(car *obj, const T value) {
    obj->rem = value;
    obj->img = 0;
}
```

In the modified code:

- The `typedef double T;` is used to define a typedef for the type `double` and name it `T`, similar to the original code.

- The `class car` is replaced with a C struct named `car`. It contains two variables of type `T`: `rem` for the real part and `img` for the imaginary part.

- The constructor `car(const T& r, const T& i)` in C++ is replaced with a C function `car_init` that initializes a `car` object. It takes a pointer to the object to be initialized (`obj`) and the real and imaginary values (`r` and `i`) as arguments.

- The constructor `car(const Ty_& r)` in C++ is replaced with a C function `car_copy` that copies the values from one `car` object to another. It takes a pointer to the destination object (`dest`) and a pointer to the source object (`src`) as arguments.

- The `operator=` overload in C++ is replaced with a C function `car_assign` that assigns a value to the real part of the `car` object while setting the imaginary part to zero. It takes a pointer to the object (`obj`) and the value to assign (`value`) as arguments.

Here's an example of how you can use the modified C code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    car obj1;
    car obj2;

    car_init(&obj1, 2.5, 1.3);  // Initialize obj1 with real=2.5 and imaginary=1.3
    car_copy(&obj2, &obj1);     // Copy obj1 to obj2

    printf("Real part: %lf\n", obj2.rem);
    printf("Imaginary part: %lf\n", obj2.img);

    car_assign(&obj1, 3.7);     // Assign 3.7 to the real part of obj1

    printf("Real part after assignment: %lf\n", obj1.rem);
    printf("Imaginary part after assignment: %lf\n", obj1.img);

    return 0;
}
```

Please note that this conversion provides a basic translation of the code, but it may not cover all the features and functionality of the original C++ code.
