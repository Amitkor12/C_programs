# structures

* Let's break down the differences between The three code snippets:

1. `typedef struct ABC { // implementation } abc;`
In this case, you are defining a struct named `ABC` and immediately creating a typedef for it called `abc`. The struct `ABC` is defined within the typedef statement and may contain members or fields inside the curly braces. The typedef allows you to create instances of the struct using the `abc` keyword.

2. `typedef struct ABC { };`
Here, you are defining a struct named `ABC` without any members or fields inside the curly braces. Then, you create a typedef called `ABC`, which is essentially creating a new type based on the struct. However, since the struct has no members, this type is empty and doesn't provide much utility.

3. `typedef struct { // implementation } abc;`
In this case, you are defining an anonymous struct, which means it doesn't have a name associated with it. The struct is defined within the typedef statement and may contain members or fields inside the curly braces. The typedef allows you to create instances of the struct using the `abc` keyword.

Overall, the main difference between these snippets is whether the struct is given a name (`ABC`) or left anonymous. The typedef allows you to create a new type based on the struct, which can be useful for declaring variables of that type more easily.
