# Digital electronics

- Digital electronics is a field of electronics that deals with the **study and application of digital signals and systems**.
- It focuses on the **use of discrete voltage levels to represent and manipulate information**.
- Unlike analog electronics, which deals with continuous signals, digital electronics processes information in **discrete steps or binary digits (bits)**, typically represented as 0s and 1s.

- Digital electronics forms the foundation for modern computing and communication systems.
- It involves the design, analysis, and implementation of electronic circuits and devices that operate using binary logic and digital signals.
- These circuits are built using components such as **logic gates, flip-flops, registers, counters, multiplexers, and digital integrated circuits**.

    4. ***Sequential circuits*** :
        - Sequential circuits contain **memory elements**, typically **flip-flops**, which allow them to **store and remember information**.
        - These circuits have an **internal state and output depends on both current inputs and previous states**.
        - Examples include **registers, counters, and finite state machines**.

    5. ***Digital systems and processors*** :
        - Digital electronics is the basis for the design and implementation of digital systems and processors, including microcontrollers, microprocessors, digital signal processors (DSPs), and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).
        - These systems are used in various applications, ranging from consumer electronics to industrial automation and telecommunications.
