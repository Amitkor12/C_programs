The class `IMemoryManagement` is declared in this way because it follows the Singleton design pattern. 

The Singleton design pattern ensures that only one instance of a class can be created throughout the lifetime of a program. It provides a global point of access to this instance. In the code you provided, the `GetInstance` method is used to retrieve the single instance of the `IMemoryManagement` class.

The `m_pInstance` static member variable is declared as a pointer to `IMemoryManagement`. It is initialized to `nullptr` by default. In order to obtain an instance of the class, the `GetInstance` method is called. This method returns the value of `m_pInstance`, which is initially `nullptr`, but can be assigned a memory address when an instance is created.

It's worth noting that the code snippet you provided is incomplete. The `m_pInstance` variable is declared, but it is not defined or assigned a value. In a complete implementation, the `m_pInstance` variable should be defined and assigned the memory address of the singleton instance within the class implementation file.







//protected

The class `IMemoryManagement` is written in this way to enforce encapsulation and provide a global point of access to a single instance of `IMemoryManagement` using the Singleton design pattern.

Let's break down the key aspects of this implementation:

1. `GetInstance()` function: This static member function provides a way to retrieve the single instance of `IMemoryManagement`. By calling `GetInstance()`, you can access the instance, which is returned as a pointer to `IMemoryManagement`.

2. `m_pInstance` static member variable: This variable is declared as a pointer to `IMemoryManagement`. It is declared as protected, which means it can only be accessed by the class itself and its derived classes. The static member variable holds the memory address of the singleton instance.

The reason `m_pInstance` is declared as protected is to allow derived classes to access and use the instance if necessary, while still preventing external access to it.

It's important to note that the code snippet you provided is still incomplete. The `m_pInstance` variable is declared, but it needs to be defined and assigned a value within the class implementation file for the Singleton pattern to work correctly.
