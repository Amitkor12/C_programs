1. **Internet Technology** :
   * Internet technology refers to the **infrastructure and protocols** that enable the **transfer of information and communication over the internet**.

   * Key components of internet technology include:
        * **Internet Protocol (IP)** :
            * IP is a *set of rules that governs the exchange of data packets between devices connected to the internet*.
            * IP addresses are *unique identifiers assigned to devices for communication*
        * **World Wide Web (WWW)** :
            * The WWW is an *information system that allows users to access and navigate web pages and resources using hyperlinks*.
            * It relies on protocols such as *HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (HTTP Secure)* for transmitting data between *web servers and browsers*.
        * **DNS (Domain Name System)** :
            * DNS is responsible for translating *domain names (e.g., <www.example.com>) into IP addresses*.
            * It enables users to access websites using *user-friendly domain names instead of remembering IP addresses*.
        * **Web Servers** :
            * Web servers *host websites and serve web pages to clients upon request*.
            * **Apache and Nginx** are popular web server software.
        * **Protocols** :
            * Internet technology relies on various protocols for different purposes, such as *SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) for email*, *FTP (File Transfer Protocol) for file sharing*,*DHCP* and more.

2. **Web Design**:
   * Web design involves *creating and designing websites that are visually appealing, user-friendly, and functional*.
   * key elements of web design:
        * **Layout and Structure** :
            * Web designers consider the *arrangement of elements, including headers, menus, content sections, and footers*, to create an *organized and intuitive layout* for users.
        * **Visual Design** :
            * This aspect focuses on the *aesthetics of a website, including color schemes, typography, images, and graphics*.
            * The goal is to create an *attractive and visually cohesive design*.
        * **Responsive Design** :
            * With the rise of mobile devices, web designers aim to create *websites that adapt and display properly across different screen sizes and devices*.
        * **User Experience (UX)** :
            * UX design focuses on *optimizing the website's usability and enhancing the overall user experience*.
            * It involves considering factors like *navigation, load times, intuitive interfaces, and clear content hierarchy*.
        * **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** :
            * Web designers use these *core technologies to create and style web pages*.
            * HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) provides the structure.
            * CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) handles the visual presentation.
            * JavaScript adds interactivity and functionality.
        * **Content Management Systems (CMS)** :
            * CMS platforms like *WordPress, Drupal, and Joomla simplify web design and development*, allowing users to create and manage website content *without extensive coding knowledge*.
