Certainly! Here's an example in C with a `main` function that demonstrates the usage of the `IMemoryManagement` class:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct {
    struct IMemoryManagement* (*GetInstance)(void);
    struct IMemoryManagement* m_pInstance;
} IMemoryManagement;

IMemoryManagement* GetInstance(void) {
    return m_pInstance;
}

IMemoryManagement* m_pInstance;

int main() {
    // Create an instance of IMemoryManagement
    IMemoryManagement memoryManagementInstance;
    memoryManagementInstance.GetInstance = GetInstance;
    memoryManagementInstance.m_pInstance = &memoryManagementInstance;

    // Access the instance using GetInstance()
    IMemoryManagement* pInstance = memoryManagementInstance.GetInstance();

    // Print the address of the instance
    printf("Address of IMemoryManagement instance: %p\n", pInstance);

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we create an instance of the `IMemoryManagement` struct named `memoryManagementInstance`. We set the `GetInstance` function pointer to the `GetInstance` function itself and assign the address of `memoryManagementInstance` to the `m_pInstance` member variable.

Next, we use `GetInstance()` to retrieve the instance of `IMemoryManagement` and assign it to `pInstance`. Finally, we print the address of the `IMemoryManagement` instance using `printf()`.

Note that in this example, the `GetInstance()` function simply returns the address of the `m_pInstance` member variable. In a real scenario, you would typically have more complex logic in the `GetInstance()` function to handle instance creation, singleton pattern, or other memory management techniques.
