The code snippet you provided defines a class named `IMemoryManagement`. This class has a static member variable `m_pInstance` of type `IMemoryManagement*`, which is also a pointer to an `IMemoryManagement` object. The class also includes a static member function `GetInstance` that returns a pointer to the `m_pInstance` object.

Here's the C++ code:

```cpp
class IMemoryManagement
{
public:
    static IMemoryManagement* GetInstance(void) { return m_pInstance; }
    static IMemoryManagement* m_pInstance;
};
```

To translate this code into C, you would need to remove the `class` keyword and convert the member variables and functions to global variables and functions. Here's the equivalent translation in C:

```c
typedef struct {
    struct IMemoryManagement* (*GetInstance)(void);
    struct IMemoryManagement* m_pInstance;
} IMemoryManagement;

IMemoryManagement* GetInstance(void) {
    return m_pInstance;
}

IMemoryManagement* m_pInstance;
```

In C, we use a `typedef` to create an alias `IMemoryManagement` for the `struct` definition. The member functions are defined as separate global functions outside the struct. The `m_pInstance` member variable is also declared as a separate global variable outside the struct.

Note that this translation preserves the same functionality in terms of accessing the `GetInstance` function and `m_pInstance` variable. However, the code organization and naming conventions are adjusted to align with the C language syntax.
