In the original C++ code, the line `typedef abc<T> Ty_;` declares a typedef named `Ty_` that represents the type `abc<T>`. It creates an alias `Ty_` for the templated class `abc<T>`, allowing for more concise and readable code.

However, in the conversion to C, since C does not support templates, the `typedef abc<T> Ty_;` declaration cannot be directly translated. Therefore, in the modified C code, the `Ty_` variable is not present.

The purpose of the `Ty_` typedef in the original C++ code was to define a shorthand for the templated version of the `abc` class. It allowed for easier use of the template parameter `T` within the class definition or member functions. Since C does not have templates, this aliasing is not required or possible in the same way.

If you need to work with different types of `abc` objects in C, you would need to create separate struct definitions or use a more generic approach to handle different types of data.
