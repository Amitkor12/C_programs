# Analog communication

- Analog communication refers to the **transmission of information in a continuous, analog format**.
- It is the traditional method of communication that uses continuous signals to convey data.
- In analog communication, **the message signal is directly modulated onto a carrier signal, which is then transmitted through a communication medium such as wires, cables, or airwaves**.

- Analog communication systems involve **three main components** : **the input message signal, the modulation process, and the output carrier signal**.
- The message signal is an analog signal that **represents the information to be transmitted, such as voice, music, or video**.
- The modulation process **combines the message signal with a higher-frequency carrier signal, altering the carrier's characteristics to encode the information**.
- This modulation can be achieved using various techniques, including **amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), or phase modulation (PM)**.
- Once the carrier signal is modulated, it is **transmitted through the communication medium**.
- The receiver on the other end of the communication channel **demodulates the received signal to extract the original message signal**.
- Demodulation reverses the modulation process, recovering the original analog signal from the modulated carrier signal. - The demodulated signal can then be **amplified and converted back into its original form, allowing the recipient to perceive the transmitted information**.

- Analog communication has been widely used in various **applications**, such as **traditional telephony, radio broadcasting, and television**.
- However, with the advancement of **digital technology, analog communication has gradually been replaced by digital communication systems in many domains**.
- Digital communication offers advantages such as **improved signal quality, increased capacity for data transmission, and better error correction techniques**.
- Nevertheless, analog communication still finds applications in certain areas where analog signals are better suited, such as **audio reproduction and certain wireless systems**.

Overall, analog communication provides **a means to transmit continuous, real-world signals over a communication channel**, allowing the **reproduction of sound, images, and other forms of analog data at a remote location**.

## fundamental concepts in analog communication

1. ***Signal*** :
    - In analog communication, the signal represents **the information to be transmitted**.
    - It can be any **continuous waveform** that carries the *desired information*, such as **voice, music, video, or sensor readings**.
    - The signal is typically represented **as a function of time**.

2. ***Message Signal***:
    - The message signal is the **original analog signal that carries the information to be transmitted**.
    - It is typically a **low-frequency signal**, such as **an audio waveform or a video signal**.
    - The message signal is often referred to as **the baseband signal**.

3. ***Carrier Signal***:
    - The carrier signal is a **high-frequency waveform** that is **modulated with the message signal**.
    - It **acts as a carrier for the message signal**, enabling it to be **transmitted efficiently over a communication channel**.
    - The carrier signal is typically a **sinusoidal waveform with a much higher frequency than the message signal**.

4. ***Modulation*** :
    - Modulation is the **process of impressing the message signal onto the carrier signal**.
    - It involves **modifying certain characteristics of the carrier signal**, such as **amplitude, frequency, or phase**, in accordance with the **variations in the message signal**.
    - Modulation allows the **message signal** to be **effectively transmitted over a communication channel**.

5. ***Demodulation*** :
    - Demodulation is the process of **extracting the original message signal from the modulated carrier signal at the receiver's end**.
    - Demodulation **reverses the modulation process** by recovering the variations in the carrier signal that were caused by the message signal.

6. ***Amplitude Modulation (AM)*** :
    - AM is a modulation technique where the **amplitude of the carrier signal is varied in proportion to the message signal**.
    - **The variations in the carrier signal's amplitude represent the information being transmitted**.
    - AM is commonly used in applications such as **broadcast radio**.

7. ***Frequency Modulation (FM)*** :
    - FM is a modulation technique where the **frequency of the carrier signal is varied in proportion to the message signal**.
    - The variations in the **carrier signal's frequency encode the information**.
    - FM is commonly used in applications such as **FM radio and analog television broadcasting**.

8. ***Phase Modulation (PM)*** :
    - PM is a modulation technique where **the phase of the carrier signal is varied in proportion to the message signal**.
    - The variations in the **carrier signal's phase carry the information**.
    - PM is often used in applications such as **digital communication systems**.

9. ***Bandwidth*** :
    - Bandwidth refers to **the range of frequencies required to transmit a signal**.
    - In analog communication, **the bandwidth is determined by the highest frequency component present in the message signal**.
    - The **bandwidth of a modulated signal** is typically **higher than** the **bandwidth of the original message signal**.

10. ***Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)** :
    - SNR is **a measure of the quality of a communication system**.
    - It represents the **ratio of the power of the desired signal to the power of the background noise present in the system**.
    - **Higher SNR values indicate better signal quality** and **lower levels of noise interference**.
