Here's the equivalent code for the class "ABC" in C++:

```cpp
template<typename T>
class ABC {
private:
    typedef ABC<T> Ty_;

public:
    ABC(const T& a, const T& b) : re(a), m(b) {}

private:l
    T re;
    T m;
};
```

In this C++ class template, `ABC` takes a template parameter `T`. 
It has a constructor that takes two arguments of type `T` and initializes the private member variables `re` and `m`. 
The `typedef` statement inside the class defines a shorthand for the current instantiation of the template (`ABC<T>`) as `Ty_`.
Note that the members `re` and `m` are declared as private, meaning they can only be accessed within the class.

Please note that if you have any specific requirements or if you need to use this class in a particular context, you may need to provide more details or modify the code accordingly.
