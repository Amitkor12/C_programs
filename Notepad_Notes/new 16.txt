The provided code is a C++ class template named `car`, which represents a complex number. Let's break down the code and explain its functionality:

```cpp
typedef double T;

template<typename T>
class car {
    typedef car<T> Ty_;
    T rem;
    T img;

public:
    car(const T& r, const T& i) :
        rem(r),
        img(i)
    {
    }

    car(const Ty_& r) :
        rem(r.rem),
        img(r.img)
    {
    }

    const Ty_ operator=(const T& _Right)
    {
        rem = _Right;
        img = 0;
        return (*this);
    }
};
```

- `typedef double T;` declares a typedef for the type `double` and names it `T`. This allows the class template to work with different types, but in this case, it's specifically using `double`.

- `template<typename T>` introduces a template parameter `T` for the class template `car`. It indicates that the class can work with any type, which is determined when an instance of the class is created.

- `typedef car<T> Ty_;` declares a typedef for the templated version of the `car` class, named `Ty_`. This creates an alias for the specific instantiation of the class template.

- `T rem;` and `T img;` are private member variables of type `T` (which is `double` based on the typedef). They represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number.

- The constructor `car(const T& r, const T& i)` initializes the `rem` and `img` members with the provided real and imaginary values, respectively.

- The constructor `car(const Ty_& r)` allows constructing a `car` object from another `car` object of the same type. It initializes the `rem` and `img` members of the current object with the values from the provided object.

- The `const Ty_ operator=(const T& _Right)` is an assignment operator overload. It assigns the value of `_Right` to the `rem` member and sets the `img` member to zero. It returns a reference to the current object (`*this`).

In summary, the code defines a class template `car` that represents a complex number with real and imaginary parts. It provides constructors for initializing the complex number and an assignment operator overload for assigning a value to the real part while setting the imaginary part to zero. The `typedef` is used to create an alias for the templated version of the class.
